          SECTION 5 - SERVICES We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to

          region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case
          basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or

          <br></br> We do not warrant that the quality of any products,
          Services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you
          will meet your expectations.<br></br>
          <br></br> SECTION 5a DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
          <br></br>
          <br></br>The following description of services is provided for general
          informational purposes only. The actual range of Services offered may
          be expanded and updated in compliance with the provisions outlined in
          our Terms of Use.<br></br>
          <br></br> Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging services. <br></br>
          <br></br>Scarpel offers Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging
          services, allowing businesses and organizations to send SMS messages
          to their customers, employees, or subscribers. A2P messaging is
          commonly used for marketing, notifications, alerts, and customer
          engagement purposes.<br></br>
          <br></br> Our A2P messaging Service is designed to facilitate
          efficient and reliable message delivery, ensuring that your messages
          reach the intended recipients in a timely manner. As part of our
          commitment to quality service, we continuously monitor and optimize
          our A2P messaging infrastructure to maintain high message
          deliverability rates and mitigate potential delivery issues. SMS
          firewall Scarpel provides SMS firewall services to protect users from
          unauthorized or malicious SMS traffic. Our SMS firewall employs
          advanced filtering techniques to detect and block unsolicited and
          potentially harmful messages, including spam, fraud, and phishing
          attempts. Through our SMS firewall, we aim to enhance the security and
          integrity of our network, ensuring that legitimate A2P messages can be
          delivered efficiently while safeguarding users from unwanted or
          harmful content. While we strive to provide effective filtering and
          security measures, it is essential to note that no system is
          completely foolproof. We do not guarantee that all malicious or
          unauthorized content will be blocked, and you understand and agree
          that you use our Services at your own risk. Two-Factor Authentication
          (2FA) Scarpel offers two-factor authentication (2FA) solutions to add
          an extra layer of security to user accounts and sensitive
          transactions. 2FA requires users to provide a second form of
          verification (e.g., a one-time password sent via SMS) in addition to
          their regular login credentials. Our 2FA services are designed to help
          businesses protect their users' accounts from unauthorized access and
          reduce the risk of data breaches caused by weak or compromised
          passwords. By integrating our 2FA solutions into your applications or
          platforms, you can enhance the security of your services and ensure a
          safer user experience for your customers or employees. While we take
          reasonable measures to ensure the effectiveness of our 2FA solutions,
          we cannot guarantee absolute security against all forms of
          unauthorized access or data breaches. You agree to use our 2FA
          services responsibly and to take appropriate measures to protect
          authentication credentials, such as passwords, PINs, or security
          tokens. Scarpel shall not be liable for any losses or damages
          resulting from unauthorized access to your accounts or data due to
          your failure to maintain the security of your authentication
          credentials. SECTION 5b - SERVICE CUSTOMIZATION AND INTEGRATION
          Scarpel offers the flexibility to customize our Services to suit the
          specific needs of your business or organization. Depending on your
          requirements, we may provide tailored solutions, service-level
          agreements, and pricing packages. We also offer documentation and 24/7
          customer support to facilitate seamless integration of our Services
          into your existing applications or systems. SECTION 6 - ACCURACY OF
          BILLING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION We reserve the right to refuse any
          order you place with us. In the event that we make a change to or
          cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail
          and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was
          made. You agree to promptly update your account and other information,
          including your email address and credit card numbers and expiration
          dates, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as
          needed. SECTION 7 - OPTIONAL TOOLS We may provide you with access to
          third-party tools over which we neither monitor nor have any control
          nor input. You acknowledge and agree that we provide access to such
          tools ”as is” and “as available” without any warranties,
          representations or conditions of any kind and without any endorsement.
          We shall have no liability whatsoever arising from or relating to your
          use of optional third-party tools. Any use by you of the optional
          tools offered through the site is entirely at your own risk and
          discretion and you should ensure that you are familiar with and
          approve of the terms on which tools are provided by the relevant
          third-party provider(s). We may also, in the future, offer new
          Services and/or features through the website (including, the release
          of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or Services shall
          also be subject to these Terms of Service. SECTION 8 - THIRD-PARTY

          may include materials from third-parties. Third-party links on this
          site may direct you to third-party websites that are not affiliated
          with us. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the
          content or accuracy and we do not warrant and will not have any
          liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or websites,
          or for any other materials, products, or Services of third-parties. We
          are not liable for any harm or damages related to the purchase or use
          of goods, Services, resources, content, or any other transactions made
          in connection with any third-party websites. Please review carefully
          the third-party's policies and practices and make sure you understand
          them before you engage in any transaction. Complaints, claims,
          concerns, or questions regarding third-party products should be
          directed to the third-party. SECTION 9a - COMMENTS, FEEDBACK AND OTHER
          SUBMISSIONS If without a request from us you send creative ideas,
          suggestions, proposals, plans, or other materials, whether online, by
          email, by postal mail, or otherwise (collectively, 'comments'), you
          agree that we may, at any time, without restriction, edit, copy,
          publish, distribute, translate and otherwise use in any medium any
          comments that you forward to us. We are and shall be under no
          obligation (1) to maintain any comments in confidence; (2) to pay
          compensation for any comments; or (3) to respond to any comments. We
          may, but have no obligation to, monitor, edit or remove content that
          we determine in our sole discretion to be unlawful, offensive,
          threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise
          objectionable or violates any party’s intellectual property or these
          Terms of Service. You agree that your comments will not violate any
          right of any third-party, including copyright, trademark, privacy,
          personality or other personal or proprietary right. You further agree
          that your comments will not contain libelous or otherwise unlawful,
          abusive or obscene material, or contain any computer virus or other
          malware that could in any way affect the operation of the Service or
          any related website. You may not use a false e-mail address, pretend
          to be someone other than yourself, or otherwise mislead us or
          third-parties as to the origin of any comments. You are solely
          responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take no
          responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you
          or any third-party. SECTION 9b – CONTENT Scarpel does not monitor or
          control the content transmitted through our Services and does not
          claim ownership or endorse any user-generated content. However, we
          reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate action if we
          become aware of any content that violates these Terms or is deemed
          harmful to our platform or other users. SECTION 10 - PERSONAL
          INFORMATION Your submission of personal information to us is governed
          by our Privacy Policy. SECTION 11 - ERRORS, INACCURACIES AND OMISSIONS
          Occasionally there may be information on our site or in the Service
          that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may
          relate to product descriptions, pricing, promotions, offers, and
          availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies
          or omissions, and to change or update information or cancel orders if
          any information in the Service or on any related website is inaccurate
          at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted
          your order). We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify
          information in the Service or on any related website, including
          without limitation, pricing information, except as required by law. No
          specified update or refresh date applied in the Service or on any
          related website, should be taken to indicate that all information in
          the Service or on any related website has been modified or updated.

          terminate your use of the Service or any related website for violating
          any of the prohibited uses. SECTION 13 - DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES;
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY Scarpel endeavors to provide high availability
          and optimal performance of Services. However, the nature of
          telecommunication services and external factors may occasionally
          impact the availability and performance of our Services. We strive to
          maintain the reliability of our network infrastructure and promptly
          address any service disruptions or issues that may arise. However,
          Scarpel shall not be liable for any losses or damages resulting from
          temporary interruptions or performance issues beyond our control. To
          the fullest extent permitted by law, Scarpel shall not be liable for
          any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising
          out of or related to the use of our Services. We do not guarantee,
          represent or warrant that your use of our service will be
          uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free. We do not warrant that
          the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be
          accurate or reliable. You agree that from time to time we may remove
          the service for indefinite periods of time or cancel the service at
          any time, without notice to you. You expressly agree that your use of,
          or inability to use, the service is at your sole risk. The service and
          all products and Services delivered to you through the service are
          (except as expressly stated by us) provided 'as is' and 'as available'
          for your use, without any representation, warranties or conditions of
          any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties
          or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a
          particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement. In no
          case shall Scarpel, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
          agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers or
          licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct,
          indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of
          any kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue,
          lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages,
          whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict
          liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or
          any products procured using the service, or for any other claim
          related in any way to your use of the service or any product,
          including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content,
          or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of
          the service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or
          otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their
          possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the
          exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or
          incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability
          shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. You are
          solely responsible for the content of the messages and data you send
          through our Services. SECTION 14 - INDEMNIFICATION You agree to
          indemnify, defend and hold harmless Scarpel and our parent,
          subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents,
          contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers,
          interns and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including
          reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third-party due to or arising
          out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents they
          incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights
          of a third-party. SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY In the event that any
          provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void
          or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to
          the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable
          portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service,
          such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of
          any other remaining provisions. SECTION 16 - TERMINATION The
          obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the
          termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for
          all purposes. These Terms of Service are effective unless and until
          terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of
          Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our
          Services, or when you cease using our site. If in our sole judgment
          you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term
          or provision of these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this
          agreement at any time without notice and you will remain liable for
          all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or
          accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof).
