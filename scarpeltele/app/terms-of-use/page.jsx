          messaging Service is designed to facilitate efficient and reliable
          message delivery, ensuring that your messages reach the intended

          SMS firewall. Scarpel provides SMS firewall services to protect users

          advanced filtering techniques to detect and block unsolicited and
          potentially harmful messages, including spam, fraud, and phishing
          attempts. Through our SMS firewall, we aim to enhance the security and
          integrity of our network, ensuring that legitimate A2P messages can be
          delivered efficiently while safeguarding users from unwanted or
          harmful content. While we strive to provide effective filtering and
          security measures, it is essential to note that no system is
          completely foolproof. We do not guarantee that all malicious or
          unauthorized content will be blocked, and you understand and agree

          Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Scarpel offers two-factor
          authentication (2FA) solutions to add an extra layer of security to
          user accounts and sensitive transactions. 2FA requires users to
          provide a second form of verification (e.g., a one-time password sent
          via SMS) in addition to their regular login credentials. Our 2FA
          services are designed to help businesses protect their users' accounts
          from unauthorized access and reduce the risk of data breaches caused
          by weak or compromised passwords. By integrating our 2FA solutions
          into your applications or platforms, you can enhance the security of
          your services and ensure a safer user experience for your customers or
          employees. While we take reasonable measures to ensure the
          effectiveness of our 2FA solutions, we cannot guarantee absolute
          security against all forms of unauthorized access or data breaches.
          You agree to use our 2FA services responsibly and to take appropriate
          measures to protect authentication credentials, such as passwords,
          PINs, or security tokens. Scarpel shall not be liable for any losses
          or damages resulting from unauthorized access to your accounts or data
          due to your failure to maintain the security of your authentication
          credentials.
